WSA Sideloader requires access to your files in order for the "Browse Files" functionality to work, as well as reading the selected APK file for installing onto the Windows Subsystem for Android. This information is not collected or transmitted in any way.

Network functionality is only used to check for the latest WSA Sideloader version upon application launch. Your current version is not collected or transmitted, the application simply checks a text file online containing the latest version number and compares it to the current version number.
